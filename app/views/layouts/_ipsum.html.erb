Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. They were just sucked into space. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? What? We're not at all alike! I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. Besides, you look good in a dress. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Wouldn't that bring about chaos? The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Talk about going nowhere fast. The unexpected is our normal routine. Not if I weaken first. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? I'll be sure to note that in my log. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Computer, belay that order. How long can two people talk about nothing? Damage report! Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. This should be interesting. Computer, lights up!
